# crypto-pred
A test repository for predicting and modelling crypto currency prices using various statistical models and deep learning. 

This is a very crude effort trying to forecast crypto prices. The data is mostly random-walk and is hard to predict. I'll keep on trying new things as I learn more and more about it. 

# Project directory structure
The test-models directory contains all of the models that I've tried and tested on various cryptocurrencies.
